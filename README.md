Visual Basic Browser GO (VBB GO) is a lightweight and simple to use browser and can run on weak computers. BrowserGO was programmed in Visual Studio 2022 and I used Visual Basic .NET as the language, I programmed it for people who have slow PCs and also for people who carry a laptop when they go out. It weighs a few MB and it's not some of these builds aren't stable yet, I'm working on it.
