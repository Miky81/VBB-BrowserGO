Visual Basic Browser GO (VBB GO) is a lightweight and simple to use browser and can run on weak computers. BrowserGO was programmed in Visual Studio 2022 and I used Visual Basic .NET as the language, I programmed it for people who have slow PCs and also for people who carry a laptop when they go out. It weighs a few MB and some of these builds aren't stable yet, I'm working on it.

It can run on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11
REMEMBER: Always run the "VBB BrowserGO.exe" file!

Now i am working on VBB Browser PRO! You can TEST the first Beta Version (Development Version)
It can run onWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11

I also create a site about this! Go check it: https://sites.google.com/view/vbbbrowsergo/home-page
